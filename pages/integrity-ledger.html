          <p>
            The platform brings together public records, decision artifacts, and timelines in a format
            that is consistent and traceable. It is built to support researchers, journalists, and
            local stakeholders who need dependable reference points.

          <h2>What it is not</h2>
          <p>
            Integrity Ledger is not an advocacy platform, a ratings engine, or a substitute for legal
            counsel. It does not score or rank people, and it avoids speculation. The goal is access to
            verifiable records, not narratives.

          <h2>Why it matters</h2>
          <p>
            By creating a clear record of commitments and filings, the tool supports accountability
            without hostility. It helps communities track what was said, what was filed, and what was
            delivered.
