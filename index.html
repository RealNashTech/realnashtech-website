            I build and maintain practical technology for nonprofits, community groups, and public-interest organizations.
            The focus is steady infrastructure - systems designed to be clear, dependable, and accountable over time, not optimized for scale or hype.

          <h2>Why this work exists</h2>
          <p>
            Many organizations working closest to real needs operate with limited time and uncertain
            systems. I build tools that bring clarity to grant pipelines, public records, and cultural
            provenance so the work can be trusted, sustained, and handed forward responsibly.

          <p>
            Real Nash Tech & Consulting is independent and intentionally small. The work is built to
            last, with a bias toward usefulness over visibility and a commitment to long-term care.
